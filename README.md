## Installing and Running Locally

To set up the project locally with Svelte and Deno for TypeScript, follow these steps. If you don't have Svelte installed globally, you can install it as part of the setup process:

1. Ensure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed on your system.

2. Install Svelte globally (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g svelte
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   deno install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   deno task dev --open
   ```
